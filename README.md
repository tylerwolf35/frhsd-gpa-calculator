Calculate your GPA on the Freehold Regional High School District (FRHSD) scale.

## Run as notebook:
Download "gpa.ipynb" and open it in a Jupyter environment of your choice or just click the "Open in Colab" or "launch binder" badges above.

## Run from source:
1. Have Python installed.
2. Download the file "gpa.py".
3. Open up a terminal of your choice and go to the dicretory where the file is and run the command "python3 gpa.py" or however you call 
for Python with the distribution you have chosen.

### What I plan to add:
* Automatically calculate credit from class
* Use letter instead of weight
* Web App
