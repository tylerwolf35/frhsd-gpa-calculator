# FRHSD GPA Calculator
Calculate your GPA on the Freehold Regional High School District (FRHSD) scale.

## How to Run:
1. Have Python Installed from [Python](https://www.python.org/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).
2. Download the file "gpa.py".
3. Open up a terminal of your choice and go to the dicretory where the file is and run the command "python3 gpa.py" or however you call for Python with the distribution you have chosen.

### What I plan to add:
* Automatically calculate credit from class
* Use letter instead of weight
* GUI Application
